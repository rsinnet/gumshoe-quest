# Mystery Game

Become a detective and solve mysteries!

You are presented with a mystery and a synopsis of what is known. This
initial synopsis will give you some leads to get you started. Based on
these leads, you visit various locations and speak to various NPCs. Your
goal is to discover clues that can be used to piece together an
explanation for the mystery.

When you determine a clue, it will be logged to your detective notebook.
Beware, some clues are actually red herrings! Once you've collected all
the clues, you can solve the mystery.
