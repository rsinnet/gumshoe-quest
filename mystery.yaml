solution: |
  Piecing these facts together, the solution points to Evelyn's
  assistant being the culprit. The assistant had access to the house
  and could deactivate the security system (Fact 3), explaining the lack
  of forced entry (Fact 5). The gardener's observation (Fact 9) and the
  assistant's financial troubles (Fact 10) provide motive and suspicious
  behavior. The cryptic note (Fact 7) seems like a red herring, possibly
  intended to mislead the investigation or throw suspicion on the rival
  author, who is known for dramatic gestures (Fact 6). The neighbor's
  testimony (Fact 4) could align with the assistant's build and the time
  frame he was at the house. The open window (Fact 2) might have been an
  attempt to suggest a break-in. Evelyn's absence due to her meeting
  (Fact 1) provided the perfect opportunity for the theft.

Conclusion: |
  Evelyn's assistant stole the manuscript, motivated by financial gain,
  and tried to cover his tracks by implicating the rival author and
  staging a break-in.
